# Smart-Vehicle
This project is a complete design of a vehicle equipped with a robotic arm.
Files contain 2D designs of the chassis, which could be lasercut using a lasercutter.
Lasercut parts could be attached to each other, to make the final design.
Same applies for the robotic arm, howvever, the arm requires m3 screws to be attached.
The arm was from MEARM V1, the design is open source.
Electronic design will be available soon.
The code merged everything together.
